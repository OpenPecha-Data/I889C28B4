	<h2>A Homage to His Holiness the Dalai Lama</h2>
<p><em>by Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche</em></p>
<p>Oá¹ Svasti! </p>
<p>In your enlightened form, replete with the signs and marks of perfection,<br/>
You embody the wisdom, love and strength of all the omniscient buddhas and bodhisattvas.<br/>
You are the very form of compassion, the Lotus-Holder PadmapÄá¹i, in the
guise of a saffron-clad monk.<br/>
Great leader and champion of world peace, only protector of the Tibetan
people,<br/>
Omniscient lord of victorious ones, Tenzin Gyatso, to you I pay homage, my body, speech and mind filled with devotion!</p>
<p>Gentle and magnificent, holy lord MaÃ±juÅrÄ«, you forsake your form with
five knots of hair,<br/>
To appear as one who observes the monastic vows. Master of speech,<br/>
Whose teachings exactly suit the capacity of your disciples,<br/>
You are the great one, who shows us the excellent path.</p>
<p>As you manifest in our 'World of Endurance' in a perfect buddha formâ<br/>
The play of the wisdom of abandoning and realizationâ<br/>
Oceans of scholars and siddhas, who uphold the traditions of sÅ«tra and
tantra,<br/>
Throng before you, eager and active to serve you. </p>
<p>All the great ones in the three realms of this world<br/>
Strive to look on your noble face, to hear your eloquent words;<br/>
In every continent your influence holds swayâ<br/>
Victorious over all, you have no equal.</p>
<p>Seeing your form, such faith consumes us the hairs on our body rise,<br/>
Simply to hear your voice is enough to captivate our minds,<br/>
To think of you sows the seed of altruism withinâ<br/>
Who could ever be a second Lion of the ÅÄkyas, if it were not you? </p>
<p>Having begun with these verses, I shall now turn to my main theme: </p>
<p>You are the representative of our compassionate guide, Lord Buddha; you are the magical display of Padmasambhava, the 'second buddha' of Orgyen; you are a guide to each and every being, and the gods as well. In the presence of the buddhas, endless and without limit, you took your pledge; now the force of your great waves of aspiration, through beginningless time, has ripened, and you are the great king who turns the wheel of Dharma. </p>
<p>Of a billion scholars and siddhas, you are their crown jewel, your vast
enlightened activity the light of ten million suns, flooding the whole face
of the earth. Great being, you are the crowning ornament of all samsara and nirvÄá¹a, a guide for all beings-gods and humans, all-knowing and all-seeing lord, Your Holiness the great Fourteenth Dalai Lama, in fact, to give your name in full: JetsÃ¼n Jampal Ngawang Lobzang YeshÃ© Tenzin Gyatso Sisum Wangyur Tsungpa MepÃ© DÃ©,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> a name that rings out everywhere, by renown and through reputation, from the very summit of the three realms of existence, and in all the ten directions.</p>
<p>When the lotus-like tongues of great bodhisattvas are incapable of
recounting the real story of your inconceivable and secret life, how can an
ordinary person like me, encumbered with all the fetters, ever be able to
express it? It would be like trying to measure the sky by arm's lengths, or
the ocean in handfuls. </p>
<p>So let us confine ourselves to what is common knowledge: Although you
attained complete enlightenment as the Sugata 'Noble in Every Way', out of your great compassion for the infinity of beings, you manifested once again as the Brahmin 'Radiant Youth' in the noble land of India. Then, in a
succession of marvellous rebirths, you took on countless lives as
ÅrÄvakas, pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas, and inconceivable ones as
learned paá¹á¸itas and accomplished mahÄsiddhas.</p>
<p>In Tibet the land of snows, you also took rebirth, just as the Buddha had
prophesied. Ever since humans first populated this region, you have
appeared there as kings, ministers, scholars and siddhas. Specifically, in
your lives from Nyatri Tsenpo onwards, as the Dharma King Songtsen Gampo, Trisong Detsen, DromtÃ¶n Gyalwe Jungne, Ngadak NyangtÃ¶n, Guru ChÃ¶kyi Wangchuk and others, you introduced the buddhas' precious teaching into the benighted land of Tibet, you established it there, and you ensured it would develop and spread.</p>
<p>In particular, you appeared as the succession of Dalai Lamas, beginning
with the omniscient GendÃ¼n Drubpa, and including especially the omniscient 'Great Fifth' Dalai Lama Ngawang Lobzang Gyatso, whose strength of mind and compassion were unparalleled, and then the Thirteenth Dalai Lama Thubten Gyatso. He took rebirth at once, and now among all the Dalai Lamas, you are exceptional and unique. In this golden line of incarnations, up to and including the fourteenth, you have appeared continuously in the saffron robes of one who keeps the monastic discipline. You have dispelled the darkness of these degenerate times for countless beings, from Tibet and elsewhere, with the shining light of the teachings and in your role as a secular leader. And you have given them the very greatest gift of all: the opportunity to enjoy a sublime and luminous feast of Dharma, prosperity, happiness and well-being. As it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, as the aspirations of all the buddhas combined,<br/>
You appear in an enlightened form, complete with all signs and marks of
perfection;<br/>
When the golden thread of Buddha's teachings is so close to breaking,<br/>
You manifest once more, with the intention to maintain and continue it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just so, you are the embodiment of the wisdom, love and strength of the
thousand buddhas, throughout the whole of space and all of time. In this
period, when the golden thread of the precious Buddhist teachings is in
danger of being broken, you have manifested intentionally out of your
compassion in a <em>rÅ«pakÄya</em> form, replete with every sign and mark of
perfection.</p>
<p>Time and its changes may have turned the Land of Snows into an uncivilized part of the world, and yet through your kindness and your compassion India, Nepal and the countries of the West, formerly lands devoid of the teachings, have been transformed into domains of Dharma, heralding in a second 'Age of Perfection'. Your great compassion brings all beings everywhere to a state of peace. For those who wear monastic robes and keep the three vows, you are their crowning ornament. And it is the whole world's good fortune, and that of each and every one of us, that you are here in all your magnificence, like Mount Meru resplendent at the centre of the universe. </p>
<p>Single-handedly you take upon yourself all the wondrous deeds of the
buddhas and bodhisattvas. Assuming the nine supreme styles of activity, a
great exalted one, you possess learning, discipline and kindness in equal
measure, and the skill and compassion to uphold, sustain and further the
non-partisan teaching of Buddha, that is, the ten great pillars of doctrine
and the eight great chariots of the lineages of practice. You have
maintained them, and you do so now, and in this final era, an age of
negativity such as this, when the great glut of faults of the five
degenerations runs rampant, you take on the activity of a fearless and
victorious warrior.</p>
<p>You strive to bring the happiness and well-being of lasting peace to this
universe, and to restore all that is positive and virtuous to the teachings
and beings, wherever you have students, and all over this world of ours.
Without ever tiring, without ever ceasing, day and night, you continue your
vast noble work. </p>
<p>All through this time, your extraordinary aspiration has grown ever more,
and your kindness in travelling to India, land of the Äryas, has made it
possible for you to journey to those 'borderlands' unvisited by previous
Dalai Lamas and untouched by their teachings. In these countries, you have taken on students and so planted the seed of liberation and omniscience in countless minds. Even an offering of the billion-fold universe, filled with priceless jewels, would not suffice to repay such kindness!</p>
<p>Now today in France, under the protection of your compassion, a wealth of
teachings can be enjoyed in centres following the Nyingma Old Translation
school, the glorious Sakya order, the Kagyu tradition of the four
transmissions, the great Gelukpa lineage, and others. In each of them, the
particular views and practices of their own tradition are upheld, nurtured
and spread. All these centres are united and, in real devotion, with the
three kinds of faith, and as if with a single voice, they invite you. Your
work for world peace, through the Dharma and through secular means, leaves you no spare time, and yet because of your great compassion, altruism and love, you promised you would come. And so for countless groups of faithful practitioners in France, your inconceivable kindness will produce a great rain of sacred Dharma.</p>
<p>The Great Thirteenth Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, received the nectar-like
teachings of the Old Translation school from TertÃ¶n Lerab Lingpa,
also known by the name of SÃ¶nam Gyalpo. His incarnation, recognized and
enthroned by Dzongsar Khyentse JamgÃ¶n ChÃ¶kyi LodrÃ¶ Rinpoche and known as Sogyal Rinpoche, has, together with his assistants, requested you ardently to visit his centre of Lerab Ling. Before your arrival, the monks of your monastery Pende Lekshe Ling, the Namgyal Monastery, headed by their abbot, will perform a <em>drupchen</em> of <em>Phurba Yang Nying Pudri</em>, which was a regular practice of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama. At the conclusion, you will arrive and in all your kindness bestow a feast of Dharma that ripens and liberates. </p>
<p>At this critical time, when the five degenerations are on the rise, all
those who have faith, whoever they may be, should remember the kindness of our unsurpassed teacher, the supreme sage, the great SiddhÄrtha. And particularly, now that the sacred Dharma has been introduced into so many countries previously untouched by the teachings, one thing is certain-it is entirely due to your kindness and your aspirations, you who are the display of the omniscient PadmapÄá¹i, you the lord among victorious ones, the great Vajradhara. Having been reminded of your acts of kindness like these, may we enjoy the inconceivable, inexpressible good fortune of looking on your noble face, which liberates on sight; and enjoying the feast of your teachings, which liberate upon hearing!</p>
<p>As the Buddha himself said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All dharmas originate from a cause,<br/>
The TathÄgata has taught this cause.<br/>
That which brings the cause to cessationâ<br/>
This too, has been taught by the great ÅrÄmaá¹a.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commit not a single unwholesome action,
Cultivate a wealth of virtue,
To tame this mind of ours:
This is the teaching of the Buddha. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By relying on the practice of such a sublime and sacred Dharma, may this
sun of the Buddha's teachings shine on all the countries of the world, and
sweep them in its all-embracing light! And may the minds of all sentient
beings blossom, as they ripen and actualize the result of the precious
bodhicitta of the MahÄyÄna! </p>
<p>Please take great care that this comes to pass: Know us! Care for us! Be
our guide!</p>
<p>With my hands together at my heart, I make this prayer.</p>
<p><em>As requested by the Dharma community of Lerab Ling, this was written by the one known as Dzarong Trulzhik Shatrul, the bewildered ChÃ¶kyi LodrÃ¶, who merely bears the outward appearance of a Buddhist monk, on the third day of the fourth month of the Iron Dragon year, 2127, two thousand five hundred and forty-four years after the parinirvÄá¹a of Lord Buddha.</em></p>
